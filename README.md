## Overview

BnMMLU is a benchmark to evaluate the multitask language understanding capabilities of Bengali in language models. The dataset spans 23 domains including science, humanities, mathematics, and general knowledge, structured in a multiple-choice format to assess factual knowledge, application-based problem-solving, and reasoning abilities of language models.

## Dataset

The BnMMLU dataset consists of 138,949 question-option pairs across 23 domains. The dataset is available on HuggingFace:

## Features

- Comprehensive evaluation across 23 domains
- Multiple-choice format with 4 options per question
- Annotations for cognitive categories: factual knowledge, procedural application, and reasoning
- Train/validation/test splits for model development and evaluation

## Usage

Code for loading and evaluating models on the BnMMLU benchmark will be available soon.
